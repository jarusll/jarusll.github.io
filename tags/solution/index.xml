What are S and F when S moves by 1 element and F moves by 2 elements?
S is slow pointer and F is fast pointer Will S travel half the distance of F at any given point?
Yes, since F is twice as fast as S Will S be at middle of list when F is at the end?</description></item><item><title>Middle of Linked List</title><link>https://surajyadav.xyz/posts/middle-of-linked-list/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://surajyadav.xyz/posts/middle-of-linked-list/</guid><description>2 Pointers ðŸ”— In the list 1-&amp;gt;2-&amp;gt;3-&amp;gt;4-&amp;gt;5, S and F point to 1.

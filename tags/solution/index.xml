On 13th of April, 2022 I was stuck with a ref lock thing with my portfolio repo. It was really dirty one and the only way I solved it was importing the repo to bitbucket &amp;amp; reimporting it back. Made me think about backups.
Fortunately, I was tinkering with Ansible1. It was a good learning opporunity, mirror my repos using Ansible and I did it.</description></item></channel></rss>

Todays plan is to host the site on vps. The biggest letdown will be cicd. I have automated build triggers on submodule push. I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;ll achieve that on vps.</p><p>I have <code>next lexicographic permutation</code> in pipeline today.</p><p>Brainfucked myself with firewall rules. For some reason 443 wasn&rsquo;t going through it. I switched to <code>ufw</code> and allowed all necessary ports and it worked. I can start migrating my site to vps.</p><p>I won&rsquo;t automate anything for now.

I feel like the code is redundant. Once idea has been passed, people can do it themselves. I&rsquo;ll soon move to psudocode</p><p>I got the Oracle free forever VPS. I&rsquo;ll setup hosting my website on it. If everything goes well, I&rsquo;ll setup a git instance as well. All of this using tailscale.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t see any point in having <code>fragments</code>. I&rsquo;ll merge it asap.</p><p>I tried some Ruby today. Its the closest thing to smalltalk. It has definitely peaked my curiosity and I know I&rsquo;ll be solving Ruby koans soon.</p><p>Recently Gopher came up in a conversation so I looked up other web protocols. I browsed gemini and gopher and I like the simplicity. I&rsquo;ve always tried to go the other way. I don&rsquo;t need performance or fancy graphics. Thats why I use i3 and live in emacs. I&rsquo;ll look into porting my site to gemini and gopher. I&rsquo;ll be reading about them as well.</p><h1 id=2022-05-28>2022-05-28 <a href=#2022-05-28 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><p>I am totally skipping over shared memory model in concurrency. Its too tedious and I&rsquo;ll never use it IRL.</p><p>I did it. My magnum opus till now. <a href=https://surajyadav.xyz/fragments/generate-permutations/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Generating Permutations</a>.
Written & evaluated in <code>org-mode</code>. Socratic dialogue + first principles. I am very proud of myself.
I will continue writing.</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t been able to write because of less desk time. I ordered a wireless keyboard. Its about time I go mobile.

The new site didn&rsquo;t had the submodule push triggers. Added. Testing again.</p><p>IT WORKS!!!!!!!! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</p><p>Tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll fix the assets and it should be good to go.</p><h1 id=2022-05-25>2022-05-25 <a href=#2022-05-25 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><p>My leetcode practice & horizontal scaling obsession paid off. Fingers crossed.
I came across Bionic reading today. Its my new obsession. I installed a chrome extension so its on every page. I converted all my ebooks to bionic & sent to kindle. Been a while since I was this excited about reading.</p><p>I increased my font size on every system and my readability increased alot.</p><p>I have been thinking about hugo because of its native support for org files. Let me think about this.</p><h1 id=2022-05-24>2022-05-24 <a href=#2022-05-24 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><p>I have been looking up to something.
I read abit about Hadoop today. I am very interested in horizontal scaling these days.</p><p>Good day</p><h1 id=2022-05-23>2022-05-23 <a href=#2022-05-23 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><p>Personal day.</p><h1 id=2022-05-22>2022-05-22 <a href=#2022-05-22 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><p>I binged Love, Death & Robots last night.</p><p>I played Transistor today. Its aesthetic. The art style and the little touches like the humming and the songs, this definitely makes in my top 10 list.</p><p>Today&rsquo;s plan is to solve some leetcode problems.</p><p><code>It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a DestroyBaghdad procedure.

Pretty good in frontend. Average in backend. The backend assessment had alot of cryptographic security questions.</p><p>Tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll start publishing org-mode. The plan is to get the system up ASAP and then I can port my site slowly.</p><h1 id=2022-05-19>2022-05-19 <a href=#2022-05-19 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><p>I&rsquo;ll be reading about horizontal scaling today. System design is my new obsession.</p><h1 id=2022-05-18>2022-05-18 <a href=#2022-05-18 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><p>The sample fullstack app is ready.</p><p>I had the whole thing up & running on localhost & I thought about trying it on my phone and oops, it doesn&rsquo;t run since localhost no longer points to my pc running the backend. Hopefully, the people from docker discord server helped me out and I learnt that its out of scope of my task.</p><p>Random people from discord are way helpful than any person I&rsquo;ve met. You post one issue and two of them spam you with solutions and encourage you to ask more questions. Nice people.
Here&rsquo;s the server <a href=https://discord.gg/XwvrsZ6r target=_blank rel=noopener>Docker Discord server</a></p><h1 id=2022-05-17>2022-05-17 <a href=#2022-05-17 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><p>Finally was able to get Prisma working in docker.</p><p>And after that I wasn&rsquo;t able to access the db instance from internal network. Turns out I was trying to access on external port. This was the first time I am trying to setup a full stack app.</p><p>Tomorrow I should be able to be done with bulk of the problem. And then only finishing touches.</p><p>Good day, night</p><h1 id=2022-05-16>2022-05-16 <a href=#2022-05-16 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><p>I&rsquo;ll be messing around with Databases & its design for a while.</p><p>I am a beginner with database modelling. I could really improve there. I have decided to master psql and redis for now.</p><h1 id=2022-05-15>2022-05-15 <a href=#2022-05-15 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><p>Plan is to dockerize a fullstack sample app.
This evil & emacs combo is working very good. I don&rsquo;t want to switch my workflow to evil fully. I just want vim&rsquo;s powerful motions.
For the rest, emacs will do.</p><p>Integrating the backend is remaining in frontend.
Barebones backend is up.
DB needs to be implemented.
The whole thing is dockerized.</p><p>I tweaked which-key for faster response time. I still need a way to make which-key overlay on all the time. I&rsquo;ll be looking into it soon.</p><p>Good day, Night.</p><h1 id=2022-05-14>2022-05-14 <a href=#2022-05-14 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><p>I switched to <code>evil-mode</code>. The plan is to use evil-mode for editable buffers & emacs for read-only buffers.</p><p>I had my personal day.</p><h1 id=2022-05-13>2022-05-13 <a href=#2022-05-13 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><p>I wasn&rsquo;t able to complete the challenge but on the upside I can write programs literate style now.</p><p><p class=markdown-image><img src=/images/d312a0c721255e43827d273349806bcf.jpg alt=Image></p></p><p><p class=markdown-image><img src=/images/42a5a9804d0033e4ef3586135fd2d355.jpg alt=Image></p></p><h1 id=2022-05-12>2022-05-12 <a href=#2022-05-12 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><p>I made a small mistake of using JSON as storage, should&rsquo;ve gone with sqlite. I can&rsquo;t serialize python datetime into jsonvalue.
I have to look into it.</p><p>Second, this is the first time I am using org-mode & literate programming for my development. I am still figuring out optimal ways to use it. I run snippets as well so the dev is iterative. I write a main program with the logical chunks-tags and then write those chunk tags in another block. But I want to test the chunk as well, so I write another block to test that code. If there are dependencies for a chunk, the get expanded as well so code is duplicated in the source file. I need to come up with a better solution for this so I can write my program as chunks, test them and the resulting source has no duplication.</p><p>All of this because I want to organize my program like a blog and instant feedback.</p><h1 id=2022-05-11>2022-05-11 <a href=#2022-05-11 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><p>Couldn&rsquo;t use my pc or wifi for 24 hours because the socket broke down.</p><p>Worked on the devops problem. Should be done by tomorrow.</p><h1 id=2022-05-10>2022-05-10 <a href=#2022-05-10 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><p>Started with a devops challenge, I am using literate programming for it and I am absolutely loving it. I am going in blind. Lets see if I can do this.</p><h1 id=2022-05-09>2022-05-09 <a href=#2022-05-09 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><p>Looked into noweb.</p><p>Occupied with personal stuff.</p><h1 id=2022-05-08>2022-05-08 <a href=#2022-05-08 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><p>I came across noweb for org-mode and I have fallen in love with it. It allows me to write seperate chunks of code and include in other chunks. I can start writing literate programs now.</p><p>The other problem, more of an inconvenience is lack of support for org-mode for 11ty framework. I am looking into exporting my site to org-mode.</p><p>When I seperate the code in chunks and prepend the required code for evaluation, the prepended code also shows up in export. The prepended code is duplicated so it shows up twice. Using the <code>:noweb strip-export</code> flag fixes it. This is turning out to be real good.</p><p>Nixos would be an overkill for me. Another alternative for me would be managing dotfiles using GNU Stow and flatpak everything (I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s possible).</p><p>I am diving deeper in literate programming. I came across Leo editor today and I&rsquo;ll check it out tomorrow</p><p>Good day, night</p><h1 id=2022-05-07>2022-05-07 <a href=#2022-05-07 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><p>Org-mode is very good. Good as in it can take over my life for documentation, programming and note taking.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll be moving towards org mode slowly.</p><p>Maybe in an year I can get really efficient with org-mode and migrate my site to it.</p><p>I wrote a literal program in org-mode today. I still need to figure out how to integrate it on my site because it uses markdown. There are some issues which need to be fixed for markdown export from org-mode.</p><p>Good day, night.</p><h1 id=2022-05-06>2022-05-06 <a href=#2022-05-06 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><p>I am just spamming recursion with memoization and I am loving it.</p><p>I got TLE(Time Limit Extended) on 2 medium Dynamic programming problems today.

Recursion still seems to have downside with function call overhead. But I still prefer it over iterative solutions.</p><p>I have decided to publish the solutions as literate programming, using emacs <code>org-mode</code></p><p>I&rsquo;ll be getting better at <code>org-mode</code> for the coming week.</p><p>Solved some more linked list & doubly linked list problems.

I am very comfortable with Binary search now.
I will be doing BSTs and Linked lists tomorrow.
I am going to treat myself with icecream.</p><p>Leetcode still did that thing of passing Wrong Answer verdict for a working solution. I do not know what the issue is and I cannot do anything about it.</p><p>Solved some more of linked list. I missed recursion. Its back.</p><p>I feel I am ramping up with my problem solving skills.

They will be fragments of cool things which don&rsquo;t belong in my diary.</p><p>Night friend.</p><h1 id=2022-03-31>2022-03-31 <a href=#2022-03-31 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><h3 id=plan-for-today-19>Plan for today <a href=#plan-for-today-19 class=anchor>🔗</a></h3><ul><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> finish elisp koans</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> draw portal companion cube</li></ul><p>Have been looking into guix, this is definitely something I&rsquo;ll look into someday.</p><p>I feel like I have familiarized myself with emacs well to move around quick enough. Next plan would be to setting custom keybinds.</p><p>Emacs has a diary. I looked into it. My current setup works for now given that I push from my phone as well.</p><p>All this time I have been on a scavenged linux setup. I picked the first obvious solution & stuck to it. I really want to craft a system and stick to it.
The setup will be</p><ul><li>minimal</li><li>stable</li><li>deterministic</li></ul><p>I haven&rsquo;t looked at guix yet but scheme as config language does seem appealing to me plus its something new so fun.</p><p>I read some of &ldquo;One more thing: stories & other stories&rdquo;. Good short stories.</p><p>I looked at nixos, I like the idea. Now I need to find out & justify if it works for me.</p><p>I finished the koans, there are 2 koans but they are exercise. I might do them if I feel like it. Right now, I have to digest some elisp. I&rsquo;ll come back to these after a day or two.</p><p>Haven&rsquo;t been able to do alot these days because I have been helping at home. If it becomes extreme I might look for a laptop or travel keyboard so I can work from phone.</p><p>Good day, night friend.</p><h1 id=2022-03-30>2022-03-30 <a href=#2022-03-30 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><h3 id=plan-for-today-20>Plan for today <a href=#plan-for-today-20 class=anchor>🔗</a></h3><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> finish elisp koans</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> setup krita/libresprite for drawing</li></ul><p>Easy day, woke up late. Need to fix my sleep schedule. I wish I can get back my lost sleep but that&rsquo;s not possible.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll draw the portal companion cube today.</p><p>One of these days need to think about seo. It feels spammy and unethical. I&rsquo;ll keep it clean.</p><p>Found out a really sweet <a href=http://clojurescriptkoans.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Clojure Koans website</a>. Will give it a try soon.</p><p>Helped out Xeon with his assignment today. Java isn&rsquo;t that bad. I&rsquo;ll give it a try someday.</p><p><code>"CL (and elisp!) provides the programmer with more than enough rope to hang themself."</code> - <em>elisp-koans</em></p><p>I like introspection. Thats one of the big reasons I like emacs & smalltalk.</p><h1 id=2022-03-29>2022-03-29 <a href=#2022-03-29 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><h3 id=plan-for-today-21>Plan for today <a href=#plan-for-today-21 class=anchor>🔗</a></h3><ul><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> figure out data sources for d2newspaper</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> do elisp koans</li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> watch system crafters</li></ul><p>Came across <code>elcord-mode</code>, discord rich presense for emacs. Looks cool.
<code>recentf-mode</code>, remembers all the recent files. I am using it now.</p><p>Just found out about <code>describe-symbol</code> in emacs. It gives documentation about elisp symbols.</p><p>One thing that I really want to master in emacs is motions, moving around in buffer fast, really fast. Thats the thing I liked about Vim alot. If I can make it happen here, I won&rsquo;t need any vi emulation modes.</p><p>One of these days I&rsquo;ll draw the portal companion cube artwork. I got one online but it seems unethical. I&rsquo;ll make my own.</p><p>Seems like <code>ssh-add</code> doesn&rsquo;t persist. I don&rsquo;t know how long but it doesn&rsquo;t. I am trying out <code>git config credential.helper store</code>. Lets see if this works.</p><p>I know just enough about elisp so that I can read the manual & get stuff done.
Also the credential helper thing doesn&rsquo;t store any ssh keys. I&rsquo;ll have to look into it soon.</p><p>Found out <code>which-key</code>, It lists all the commands available in current mode.
Here&rsquo;s a preview from<p class=markdown-image><img src=https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key/raw/master/img/which-key-bottom.png alt=justbur/emacs-which-key></p>This is very helpful. I can just scroll through the commands to see what action I want, It shows the keybind as well. After a while it&rsquo;ll become second nature.</p><p>Me and Wolfie figured out how to get all the data for d2newspaper. We&rsquo;ll be using jq to filter out. Should be easy. ezpz.</p><p>Holy shit <code>which-key</code> is fucking awesome. If I enable <code>which-key-mode</code>, I can type out Key combinations and wait for the suggestions. This is exactly what I was looking for.</p><p>Actually good day, learnt alot about Emacs. Day rating - 6/10. Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll try to finish elisp-koans.
Ez, night friend</p><h1 id=2022-03-28>2022-03-28 <a href=#2022-03-28 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><h3 id=plan-for-today-22>Plan for today <a href=#plan-for-today-22 class=anchor>🔗</a></h3><ul><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> setup <code>D2Newspaper</code></li><li><input checked disabled type=checkbox> fix posts github script</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> setup git on android</li></ul><p>The mount is here. Power tools are scary.
I have enough desk space now, I can use my drawing tablet.
I set it up everything. I ll play Far Changing Tides, I&rsquo;ve earned it.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll be messing around with emacs lisp for a while. My goal is to start talking in terms of emacs objects like buffers, windows & frames and then write some trivial macros.</p><p>Man I love magit, I am quickly able to do git actions which is letting me make rapid small changes. Good stuff.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll be trying out <a href=https://github.com/jtmoulia/elisp-koans target=_blank rel=noopener>elisp koans</a>
I did some elisp koans. I expected emacs types but this is standard lisp stuff.
Anyways the youtube series by System Crafters should get me upto speed with emacs types.</p><p>I wanted to open my diary file quickly, I came across emacs registers. You can store any thing, good stuff. I stored my diary file at d. So I can access it by <code>C-x r j d</code> from anywhere in emacs. ezpz.</p><p>Easy day, pushed &ldquo;What motivates me&rdquo;, started with elisp. System crafters should get me upto speed with Emacs.</p><p>Planned about d2newspaper. Lets make this happen.</p><p>Night friend</p><h1 id=2022-03-27>2022-03-27 <a href=#2022-03-27 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><h3 id=plan-for-today-23>Plan for today <a href=#plan-for-today-23 class=anchor>🔗</a></h3><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> setup <code>D2Newspaper</code></li></ul><p>There&rsquo;s alot of dust buildup in my pc, need to clean it. I ll do it when the mount arrives.</p><p>Wolfie talked about how he&rsquo;s missing reading books and now I want to read🥺. I will gain momentum first with short reads.</p><p>Pushed draft of &ldquo;What motivates me&rdquo;</p><p>Now that everything has been automated and decoupled, I can write articles on my phone. Need to find a good git app for Android.</p><p>Wolfie busy, we ll setup tomorrow.</p><p>Just realised I have misconfigured GitHub actions for posts and no listener for posts_push on portfolio. Will fix it tomorrow.</p><p>Day rating - 5/10.

Just found out I can add ssh keys and I won&rsquo;t have to input password. VERY BIG, love it, my life is easy.</p><p>Its been a while since I had any day off, tomorrow is my day. No work tomorrow. I ll play dota and draw.</p><p><code>The Green Knight</code> was the last decent movie I saw. I might watch some <code>Monty Python</code>.</p><p>Me and Wolfie discussed about the Destiny thing(<code>D2Newspaper</code> for now). I&rsquo;ll be working on it with him.</p><h1 id=2022-03-25>2022-03-25 <a href=#2022-03-25 class=anchor>🔗</a></h1><p>Like LoL characters, but the game feels like a mobile game.

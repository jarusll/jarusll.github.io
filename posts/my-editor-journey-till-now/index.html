My first editor was Emacs1. Why did I choose emacs? I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to exit Vim2.
I got really into programming with Scheme3. And I liked it so much I decided to choose the editor with its roots in it.
Learning emacs was just getting comfortable with its keybinds. The power of emacs comes from extensibility. Although I am a casual lisp programmer, I never bothered to learn elisp and extend emacs to my liking."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.99.1"><meta name=ROBOTS content="NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW"><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/style.css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://surajyadav.xyz/css/custom.css><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/images/favicon.ico type=image/x-icon></head><body><nav class=navigation><a href=/><span class=arrow>←</span>Home</a>

I never got the grasp on emacs modes and I felt slow in emacs. Although I am partly to blamed for not harnessing its power.</p><p>I decided to switch to Vim in 2020.
I like that just about any action is 1-3+ click/s away. I felt fast, really fast.
I felt so fast that I started using it everywhere. I use Vimium in my browser.
I use i3wm which has vim-like keybinds. I use vim keybinds in online IDEs for prototyping. I wish it was everywhere.</p><h2 id=why-am-i-switching-again>Why am I switching again? <a href=#why-am-i-switching-again class=anchor>🔗</a></h2><p><strong>2022</strong></p><p>I have recently been tinkering with smalltalk. The Pharo(or any smalltalk) IDE has been one of the best IDEs I have ever used. I know when I miss vim because I feel slow. But I never felt slow in Pharo&rsquo;s IDE. Its because you are able to reach just about anywhere within few clicks. I realized I was getting more done and was managing very less code. It made me think about extensibility.</p><p>And this made me change my mind. Its about time I did emacs properly.</p><h2 id=what-do-i-plan-to-achieve>What do I plan to achieve? <a href=#what-do-i-plan-to-achieve class=anchor>🔗</a></h2><p>One day I will start my day by opening emacs and I&rsquo;ll end it by closing emacs.
This is what I am aiming for.</p><h2 id=what-about-vim>What about Vim? <a href=#what-about-vim class=anchor>🔗</a></h2><p>I will use vim for quick edits. I will continue using it in my browser. Emacs support in browser is not functional. The motions in vim are very powerful and I plan to use Spacemacs after I get comfortable with elisp.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p><a href=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs target=_blank rel=noopener>https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p><a href=https://www.vim.org target=_blank rel=noopener>https://www.vim.org</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:3><p><a href=https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/scheme/ target=_blank rel=noopener>https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/scheme/</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:3 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:4><p><a href=https://github.com/chrisdone/elisp-guide target=_blank rel=noopener>https://github.com/chrisdone/elisp-guide</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:4 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></div></section></main><footer id=footer><div class=copyright>© Copyright

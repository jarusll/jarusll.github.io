Nokia 3310c 🔗 5th - 7th grade  Credit - https://archiwum.allegro.pl/oferta/nokia-3310c-plus-i7246256743.html
My first ever personal phone. It was Java based. I rocked this for about 2 years. I played so many games on this thing. Some of the ones I can recall is Spiderman, Street fighter ripoffs, Tomb raider. And ofc bounce."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.99.1"><meta name=ROBOTS content="NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW"><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/style.css><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/images/favicon.ico type=image/x-icon></head><body><nav class=navigation><a href=/><span class=arrow>←</span></a>

It was Java based. I rocked this for about 2 years. I played so many games on this thing. Some of the ones I can recall is Spiderman, Street fighter ripoffs, Tomb raider. And ofc bounce.</p><p>I used to spend hours downloading apps & games. And it actually took time because I had to find the ones for my phones resolution. Yes, Apps came with their own resolution. And not only that, app compatibility wasn&rsquo;t guaranteed. The only way to know it was to run it.
Some of the best apps I can recall for this phone are Facebook, Ebuddy, Opera Mini, UCBrowser. Gameloft games were big on Java.</p><h2 id=samsung-corby-pro-b5310>Samsung Corby Pro B5310 <a href=#samsung-corby-pro-b5310 class=anchor>🔗</a></h2><ul><li>7th grade - 9th grade</li></ul><p><p class=markdown-image><img src="https://ms2.tudocdn.net/203707?w=500&h=419" alt="Samsung Corby Pro B5310"></p><em>Credit - <a href=https://www.mobilescout.com/tech/news/n80650/samsung-corbypro-with-slider-qwerty-keypad.html target=_blank rel=noopener>https://www.mobilescout.com/tech/news/n80650/samsung-corbypro-with-slider-qwerty-keypad.html</a></em></p><p>The first touch & multitasking phone for me. I discovered that feature after a year. I din&rsquo;t even know Java phones had multitasking. And ofcourse the slider keyboard.</p><p>Having this thing in my pocket I no longer felt like a boy, I was a grown up man.</p><h2 id=nokia-n91>Nokia N91 <a href=#nokia-n91 class=anchor>🔗</a></h2><ul><li>9th grade - 10th grade</li></ul><p><p class=markdown-image><img src=https://fdn.gsmarena.com/imgroot/news/19/12/flashback-nokia-n91/-727/gsmarena_002.jpg alt="Nokia N91"></p><em>Credit - <a href=https://www.gsmarena.com/flashbacknokian91-news-40659.php target=_blank rel=noopener>https://www.gsmarena.com/flashbacknokian91-news-40659.php</a></em></p><p>My first Symbian phone. This was during when N95 was the coolest phone around. But I couldn&rsquo;t get one so I got an N91.</p><p>This thing was a chonky boi. I learnt alot with this phone. I tried jailbreaking & emulation. I used to emulate sega genesis & doom on this. And if you rotated & mapped the music buttons It actually felt like a handheld, just like N95.</p><p>This would be end of T9 layout for me.</p><h2 id=samsung-galaxy-y-gt-s5360>Samsung Galaxy Y GT-S5360 <a href=#samsung-galaxy-y-gt-s5360 class=anchor>🔗</a></h2><ul><li>10th Grade</li></ul><p><p class=markdown-image><img src="https://drop.ndtv.com/TECH/product_database/images/530201330723PM_635_samsung_galaxy_y.png?downsize=*:420&output-quality=80" alt="Galaxy Y"></p><em>Credit - <a href=https://gadgets360.com/samsung-galaxy-y-556 target=_blank rel=noopener>https://gadgets360.com/samsung-galaxy-y-556</a></em></p><p>My first Android phone.

I only used this to read, didn&rsquo;t really tinker around with it.
I read alot.</p><h2 id=micromax-bolt-a064>Micromax Bolt A064 <a href=#micromax-bolt-a064 class=anchor>🔗</a></h2><ul><li>11th grade - 2nd year Uni</li></ul><p><p class=markdown-image><img src="https://drop.ndtv.com/TECH/product_database/images/103201434000PM_635_micromax_bolt_ao64.jpeg?downsize=*:420&output-quality=80" alt="Micromax Bolt A064"></p><em>Credit - <a href=https://gadgets360.com/micromax-bolt-a064-2026 target=_blank rel=noopener>https://gadgets360.com/micromax-bolt-a064-2026</a></em></p><p>This was during the time When I got my first PC & I lost interest with mobile tinkering.</p><p>I still tinkered with it with Xposed modules. This was the peak of android mods. I maximised my battery life with Greenify, Amplify. Customized my ui with XBlast, hide my details with XPrivacy.</p><h2 id=vivo-y20>Vivo Y20 <a href=#vivo-y20 class=anchor>🔗</a></h2><ul><li>2nd year Uni - Current</li></ul><p><p class=markdown-image><img src=https://fdn2.gsmarena.com/vv/pics/vivo/vivo-y20-2021-1.jpg alt="Vivo Y20"></p><em>Credit - <a href=https://www.gsmarena.com/vivoy202021-pictures-10658.php target=_blank rel=noopener>https://www.gsmarena.com/vivoy202021-pictures-10658.php</a></em></p><p>I do not mess around with this phone. Its my daily driver & I want stability. I do not care about launchers or battery life or performance because it has it all. I want things to just work and it does.</p><p>I plan to use it as long as I can. When I get another phone(which is not anytime soon), this will become my emulation phone. I&rsquo;ll buy a telescopic controller & play games on it.</p></div></section></main><footer id=footer><div class=copyright>© Copyright

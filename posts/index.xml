Nokia 3310c ðŸ”— 5th - 7th grade Credit - https://archiwum.allegro.pl/oferta/nokia-3310c-plus-i7246256743.html
My first ever personal phone. It was Java based. I rocked this for about 2 years. I played so many games on this thing. Some of the ones I can recall is Spiderman, Street fighter ripoffs, Tomb raider. And ofc bounce.</description></item><item><title>My list of Emacs packages</title><link>https://surajyadav.xyz/posts/my-list-of-emacs-packages/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://surajyadav.xyz/posts/my-list-of-emacs-packages/</guid><description>My list of Emacs packages ðŸ”—magit ðŸ”—The best git interface I&amp;rsquo;ve ever used. I cannot imagine using anything else but this for git.
which-key ðŸ”—Shows completion keybinds for incomplete keys. Gets you familiar with modes.
ivy + ivy-rich ðŸ”—Completion engine for emacs. Comes with rich observability features like
Entities(command, function, variable&amp;hellip;) docstring Keybind of commands and much more features to make using the minibuffer easy.
golden-ratio ðŸ”—Automatically expands the window you switch to.</description></item><item><title>What motivates me (I think)</title><link>https://surajyadav.xyz/posts/what-motivates-me-i-think/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://surajyadav.xyz/posts/what-motivates-me-i-think/</guid><description>What motivates me (I think) ðŸ”—2 things
Variety Speed Variety ðŸ”—I have noticed about myself that I like heterogeneity whether it comes to programming or food or games. They are like flavours I want to try and I want to try all of them. It helps me grow as an individual. Its the same reason why I tried Object oriented programming when I was a hardcore functional programmer, why I mix my food unevenly so that every bite will taste different and why I explore every part of the game so that I don&amp;rsquo;t miss out on an experience.</description></item><item><title>Why I made a public diary</title><link>https://surajyadav.xyz/posts/why-i-made-a-public-diary/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://surajyadav.xyz/posts/why-i-made-a-public-diary/</guid><description>Why I made a public diary ðŸ”—I have kept things to myself all my life, because I found it hard to open up to people. And that did not help. Communication is what makes us humans(probably).
I have defintely matured to open up. Now, I try to be an open book. I want people to see me as me. I want them to know where I come from.
This diary will be my own corner.</description></item><item><title>Sweet CICD for my Portfolio</title><link>https://surajyadav.xyz/posts/sweet-cicd-for-my-portfolio/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://surajyadav.xyz/posts/sweet-cicd-for-my-portfolio/</guid><description>Sweet CICD for my Portfolio ðŸ”—What my current setup is? ðŸ”—My portfolio is hosted on Github pages. Github pages has support for selecting the directory to host. The options are &amp;ldquo;root&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;/docs&amp;rdquo; directories.
I build my portfolio locally in &amp;ldquo;/docs&amp;rdquo; directory and push it. I chose &amp;ldquo;/docs&amp;rdquo; to host in Github pages on master branch.
This setup is a bit tedious. There are 2 problems.
The build is in master repo I have to track the build in git What I want?</description></item><item><title>A bit about Consistency</title><link>https://surajyadav.xyz/posts/a-bit-about-consistency/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://surajyadav.xyz/posts/a-bit-about-consistency/</guid><description>A bit about Consistency ðŸ”—I have decided I wanna get good at Digital Art. Art is hard, it&amp;rsquo;s tough work. I want to integrate it in my life and make it second nature. I want to miss it when I am not drawing.
There&amp;rsquo;s no secret recipe to it, but brutal consistency. And so, I have decided to draw a lot of bosoms. This piece is a promise to myself.</description></item><item><title>A game which I will make(someday)</title><link>https://surajyadav.xyz/posts/a-game-which-i-will-makesomeday/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://surajyadav.xyz/posts/a-game-which-i-will-makesomeday/</guid><description>A game which I will make(someday) ðŸ”—Motivation ðŸ”—I have been playing alot of Oracle in Dota. I like the fact that he&amp;rsquo;s a double edged sword. The spell combos feel like a mini game itself and I think I can make a game out of it.
Gameplay loop ðŸ”—For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know Oracle&amp;rsquo;s spells, heres a quick introduction
Fortune&amp;rsquo;s End ðŸ”—A channeled ability which roots the enemy. Can be casted on enemy or ally.</description></item><item><title>Desi Literate Programming in Bhailang</title><link>https://surajyadav.xyz/posts/desi-literate-programming-in-bhailang/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://surajyadav.xyz/posts/desi-literate-programming-in-bhailang/</guid><description>Desi Literate Programming in Bhailang ðŸ”—What is Bhailang1? ðŸ”—According to its landing page, &amp;ldquo;A toy programming language written in Typescript&amp;rdquo;. Its a programming language based on Indian slangs, which makes it fun &amp;amp; accessible for anyone who knows Hindi.
What is Literate Programming2? ðŸ”—According to Donald Knuth, the creator of Literate programming, &amp;ldquo;Literate programming is a programming methodology that combines a programming language with a documentation language, making programs more robust, more portable, and more easily maintained than programs written only in a high-level language.</description></item><item><title>Your best friends in Emacs</title><link>https://surajyadav.xyz/posts/your-best-friends-in-emacs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://surajyadav.xyz/posts/your-best-friends-in-emacs/</guid><description>Your best friends in Emacs ðŸ”—In emacs, You are either ðŸ”— Invoking a function through a key press Invoking a function manually Describe Mode1 C-h m ðŸ”—Describe mode gives you a list of all enabled Minor modes, functions in the major mode &amp;amp; all their key binds.
I skim through describe-mode the first time I am using a mode. The functions are generally named as namespace-like-action-like-something-else. I remember the pattern so I can type out these functions with some autocompletion engine2.</description></item><item><title>Why I like Smalltalk - Part 2 of 100 - Intention revealing names</title><link>https://surajyadav.xyz/posts/why-i-like-smalltalk-part-2-of-100-intention-revealing-names/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://surajyadav.xyz/posts/why-i-like-smalltalk-part-2-of-100-intention-revealing-names/</guid><description>Why I like Smalltalk: Part 2 of 100 - Intention revealing names1 ðŸ”—A properly named message communicates well. The developer does not have to look for the implementation. This has more to do with design, but it has been in Smalltalk&amp;rsquo;s genes since its inception.
What is an intention-revealing method? A message which
Reveals intention Hides implementation Gives return type hint Intention revealing names answer what instead of how.</description></item><item><title>My Editor Journey Till Now</title><link>https://surajyadav.xyz/posts/my-editor-journey-till-now/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://surajyadav.xyz/posts/my-editor-journey-till-now/</guid><description>My Editor Journey Till Now ðŸ”—What did I start with? ðŸ”—2018
My first editor was Emacs1. Why did I choose emacs? I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to exit Vim2.
I got really into programming with Scheme3. And I liked it so much I decided to choose the editor with its roots in it.
Learning emacs was just getting comfortable with its keybinds. The power of emacs comes from extensibility. Although I am a casual lisp programmer, I never bothered to learn elisp and extend emacs to my liking.</description></item><item><title>Why I like Smalltalk - Part 1 of 100 - Documentation</title><link>https://surajyadav.xyz/posts/why-i-like-smalltalk-part-1-of-100-documentation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://surajyadav.xyz/posts/why-i-like-smalltalk-part-1-of-100-documentation/</guid><description>Why I like Smalltalk: Part 1 of 100 - Documentation ðŸ”—Smalltalk Documentation follows CRC1(Class, Responsibilities &amp;amp; Collaborators) ðŸ”— For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know what CRC is, it&amp;rsquo;s a tool that helps design objects. A CRC card consists of Class name at the top, responsibilities on the left side &amp;amp; collaborators on the right. Since a card models only one object, it enables rapid prototyping. It is feasible to go through many iterations before settling on an implementation.</description></item></channel></rss>
